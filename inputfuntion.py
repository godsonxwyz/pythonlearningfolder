#Input function and what it does
#I place an input function inside a print function to prompt for age and print wow! age


print("Wow! " + input("How old are you? ")) 



name1 = input("What is your name? ")
print(name1) #This line will print the text and line 1 of the input into the output.
name2 = len((name1))
print(name2) #This line will only print the name on line 2 of the input pane.Abr
